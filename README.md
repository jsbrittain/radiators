# Radiators

This repository provides basic scripts to monitor and log temperatures from a group of Smart Home connected radiators, and provides a local web service to display them on connected devices. These scripts rely on the `tinytuya` package which must be installed and the [full setup guidelines](https://pypi.org/project/tinytuya/) followed prior to use.
